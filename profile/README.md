# Femto Framework

## Vision

We envision a Java Framework that embodies simplicity, clarity, and efficiency. Designed to stand alone with carefully defined dependencies, it prioritizes the developer experience by providing straightforward APIs and clear documentation. This framework delivers blazing-fast performance and easy extensibility while minimizing reflection and complexity. With an open-source foundation, it invites a global community to contribute and collaborate, ensuring the tool is ready for today’s needs and tomorrow’s challenges.

## Principles

1. **Inspired by Suckless and UNIX Philosophy**  
We draw inspiration from both the Suckless and UNIX philosophies. These philosophies emphasize software that is simple, clear, and efficient. Our framework embodies these values by striving for minimalism and clarity, eliminating bloat, and promoting a deeper understanding of the underlying codebase. We build tools that do one thing well and work together seamlessly, ensuring that users who appreciate efficiency can fully harness the framework's potential.

2. **Zero Dependencies (With Carefully Defined Exceptions)**  
Our framework is built to stand alone, eliminating the need for third-party libraries and tools. However, we acknowledge that certain functionalities require specific integrations. Therefore, we adopt a rule of one-level deep dependencies, meaning our framework allows for well-thought-out, researched, and defined exceptions that are integral to its operation. Dependencies that are packaged as all-in-one or fat jars are not considered one-level and thus are not permissible, ensuring simplicity and stability.

3. **Developer Empowerment**  
We prioritize the developer experience, providing straightforward APIs and clear documentation. Our goal is to empower developers to build, deploy, and maintain applications with ease, reducing the learning curve and fostering innovation.

4. **Performance-Centric**  
Every aspect of our framework is designed with speed in mind. By leveraging the innate capabilities of Java and avoiding heavy abstractions, we deliver blazing-fast performance that meets the demands of modern web applications.

5. **Extensibility**  
While our framework is lightweight, it is also powerful. Built with modularity at its core, developers can easily extend functionality without altering the framework's foundations. This flexibility allows for adaptation to a variety of project requirements.

6. **Minimal Reflection**  
Reflection can be a powerful tool, but its overuse can lead to inefficiency and complexity. Our framework limits the use of reflection, employing it only when absolutely necessary, thus ensuring faster execution and easier debugging.

7. **Community and Collaboration**  
We are committed to transparency within our community. By making the framework’s development process open and accessible, we foster trust and collaboration. We invite developers from around the globe to contribute, engage meaningfully, and shape the project's evolution. Together, we build a tool that not only serves the needs of today but anticipates the challenges of tomorrow.
